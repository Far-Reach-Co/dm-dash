*** THESE ARE EARLY DRAFT NOTES AND ARE PLANNED TO CHANGE SOON *** A model database is being constructed that will improve clarity ***

## Technical Guidelines

### We like tools that are:

- Simple to start using

- Modifiable and extenadable

## App

A server that stores and serves up world building data

The necessary components (Primal Structures and User Assets) are simple and few but can be combined to create detailed world-building structures

Project Templates (i.e. Database Structures) can saved and duplicated/copied
    - Some will be made available as pre-made options by the App

Projects or individual Project Assets can be duplicated/copied

Each Project Asset will have designator set to either Formal or Local
    - Formal assets are essentially the default form of the asset, absent from any copyrightable game 
    - Formal assets must not contain copyrightable game mechanics that are not in the Public Domain (or at least strongly Open Source - to be considered)
    - Formal assets will have pointers to their formal dependencies (for licensing reasons)

Primal Structures, marked in the Database Structure file with an asterisk, are Project Asset categories that are necessary in every Project

Users can choose to share their Projects (or Project Templates), either publicly or with other users, but must choose a license to share under (or use a default license that will be specified in the Terms Of Service or whatever)
