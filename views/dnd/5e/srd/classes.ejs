            <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the
              cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your
              choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
              the Cleric table.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
            <p>
              The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you
              to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so,
              choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
              your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
              level for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
              1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your
              list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
              wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.
              Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
              spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in
              prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
              spell on your list.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The
              power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You
              use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your
              spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
              when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and
              when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
            <p>
              You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
            <p>
              You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting
              focus for your cleric spells.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Divine Domain</h2>
            <p>
              Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain
              is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one
              provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants
              you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st
              level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity
              when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits
              at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Domain Spells</h3>
            <p>
              Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells— that you gain
              at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you
              gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t
              count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell
              list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Channel Divinity</h2>
            <p>
              At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy
              directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical
              effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an
              effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you
              additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the
              domain description.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to
              create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your
              Channel Divinity again.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use
              such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell
              save DC.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice
              between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three
              times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you
              regain your expended uses.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h3>
            <p>
              As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
              censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within
              30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
              fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it
              takes any damage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
              from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within
              30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it
              can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
              prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature
              can use the Dodge action.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Destroy Undead</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw
              against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly
              destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain
              threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

            <h2>Divine Intervention</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene
              on your behalf when your need is great.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action.
              Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you
              roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity
              intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the
              effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be
              appropriate.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7
              days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long
              rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically,
              no roll required.

            <h2>Life Domain</h2>
            <p>
              The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the
              fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The
              gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick
              and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces
              of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim
              influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities
              (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as
              Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance
              (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of
              home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

            <h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3>
            <p>
              When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency
              with heavy armor.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Disciple of Life</h3>
            <p>
              Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
              effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to
              restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional
              hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal
              the badly injured.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              s an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy
              that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your
              cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and
              divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a
              creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't
              use this feature on an undead or a construct.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Blessed Healer</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal
              you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that
              restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit
              points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Divine Strike</h3>
            <p>
              At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes
              with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a
              creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an
              extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level,
              the extra damage increases to 2d8.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Supreme Healing</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more
              dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the
              highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of
              restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
