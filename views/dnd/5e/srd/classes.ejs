            <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the
              cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your
              choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
              the Cleric table.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
            <p>
              The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you
              to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so,
              choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
              your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
              level for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
              1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your
              list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
              wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.
              Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
              spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in
              prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
              spell on your list.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The
              power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You
              use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your
              spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
              when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and
              when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
            <p>
              You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
            <p>
              You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting
              focus for your cleric spells.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Divine Domain</h2>
            <p>
              Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain
              is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one
              provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants
              you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st
              level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity
              when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits
              at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Domain Spells</h3>
            <p>
              Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells— that you gain
              at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you
              gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t
              count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell
              list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Channel Divinity</h2>
            <p>
              At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy
              directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical
              effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an
              effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you
              additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the
              domain description.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to
              create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your
              Channel Divinity again.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use
              such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell
              save DC.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice
              between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three
              times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you
              regain your expended uses.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h3>
            <p>
              As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
              censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within
              30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
              fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it
              takes any damage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
              from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within
              30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it
              can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
              prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature
              can use the Dodge action.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Destroy Undead</h2>
            <p>

              against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly
              destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain
              threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

            <h2>Divine Intervention</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene
              on your behalf when your need is great.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action.
              Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you
              roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity
              intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the
              effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be
              appropriate.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7
              days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long
              rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically,
              no roll required.

            <h2>Life Domain</h2>
            <p>
              The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the
              fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The
              gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick
              and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces
              of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim
              influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities
              (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as
              Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance
              (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of
              home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

            <h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3>
            <p>
              When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency
              with heavy armor.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Disciple of Life</h3>
            <p>
              Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
              effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to
              restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional
              hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal
              the badly injured.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              s an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy
              that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your
              cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and
              divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a
              creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't
              use this feature on an undead or a construct.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Blessed Healer</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal
              you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that
              restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit
              points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Divine Strike</h3>
            <p>
              At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes
              with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a
              creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an
              extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level,
              the extra damage increases to 2d8.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Supreme Healing</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more
              dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the
              highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of
              restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid
              spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at
              higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid
              table.

            <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
            <p>
              The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,
              you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
              all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to
              cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a
              number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid
              level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for
              which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level
              and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
              prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
              combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you
              can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
              doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
              long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time
              spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level
              for each spell on your list.

            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since
              your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You
              use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
              ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting
              the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
              attack roll with one.
            </p>

            <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
            <p>
              You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
            <p>
              You can use a
              <a href="/dnd/5e/srd/equipment#druidic-foci">druidic focus</a>
              (see “Equipment") as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

            <h2>Wild Shape</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume
              the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this
              feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or
              long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as
              shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you
              can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or
              lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

            </table>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half
              your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal
              form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert
              to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.
              You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit
              points, or die.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
                beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and
                Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all
                of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to
                gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same
                proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher
                than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the
                creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit
                Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the
                number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if
                you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
                damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you
                take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left,
                you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage
                doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't
                knocked unconscious.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any
                action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of
                your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration
                on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from
                taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning,
                that you've already cast.
              </li>
              <li>
                You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
                other source and can use them if the new form is physically
                capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special
                senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that
                sense.
              </li>
              <li>
                You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your
                space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn
                equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is
                practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based
                on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change
                size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the
                new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with
                it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you
                leave the form.

            <h2>Druid Circle</h2>
            <p>
              At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such
              as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd
              level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Timeless Body</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you
              to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages
              only 1 year.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Beast Spells</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in
              any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic
              and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but
              you aren't able to provide material components.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Archdruid</h2>
            <p>
              At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of
              times.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of
              your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a
              cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both
              your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Circle of the Land</h2>
            <p>
              The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who
              safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral
              tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or
              standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's
              wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that
              hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those
              folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the
              land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Bonus Cantrip</h3>
            <p>
              When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional
              druid cantrip of your choice.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Natural Recovery</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy
              by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short
              rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots
              can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your
              druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level
              or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a
              long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to
              two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a
              2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Circle Spells</h3>
            <p>
              Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability
              to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain
              access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a
              druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland,
              mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it
              prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you
              can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't
              appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid
              spell for you.

              Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain
              costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical
              plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from
              them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

              In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants

              When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense
              your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When
              a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a
              Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed
              save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack
              automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune
              to this effect for 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack

              <h4>Sacred Plants and Wood</h4>
              <small>
                A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder,
                ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,
                willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a
                spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or
                sprigs of mistletoe.
              </small>
              <small class="smindent">
                Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such
                as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and
                rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be
                fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with
                strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons,
                such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is
                associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons,
                such as darts or javelins.
              </small>
              <small class="smindent">
                Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have
                chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a
                druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus
                plants.

              <h4>Druids and the Gods</h4>
              <small>
                Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most
                druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped
                in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH- B include
                many such deities). The worship of these deities is often
                considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics
                and urbanized peoples.

            <p>
              You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect
              yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to
              regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use
              this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can
              use it again.

              action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
            </p>

              in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The
