            <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the
              cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your
              choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
              the Cleric table.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
            <p>
              The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you
              to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so,
              choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
              your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
              level for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
              1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your
              list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
              wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.
              Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
              spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in
              prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
              spell on your list.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The
              power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You
              use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your
              spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
              when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and
              when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
            <p>
              You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
            <p>
              You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting
              focus for your cleric spells.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Divine Domain</h2>
            <p>
              Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain
              is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one
              provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants
              you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st
              level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity
              when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits
              at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Domain Spells</h3>
            <p>
              Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells— that you gain
              at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you
              gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t
              count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell
              list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Channel Divinity</h2>
            <p>
              At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy
              directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical
              effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an
              effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you
              additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the
              domain description.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to
              create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your
              Channel Divinity again.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use
              such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell
              save DC.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice
              between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three
              times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you
              regain your expended uses.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h3>
            <p>
              As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
              censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within
              30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
              fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it
              takes any damage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
              from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within
              30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it
              can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
              prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature
              can use the Dodge action.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Destroy Undead</h2>
            <p>

              against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly
              destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain
              threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

            <h2>Divine Intervention</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene
              on your behalf when your need is great.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action.
              Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you
              roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity
              intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the
              effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be
              appropriate.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7
              days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long
              rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically,
              no roll required.

            <h2>Life Domain</h2>
            <p>
              The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the
              fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The
              gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick
              and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces
              of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim
              influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities
              (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as
              Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance
              (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of
              home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

            <h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3>
            <p>
              When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency
              with heavy armor.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Disciple of Life</h3>
            <p>
              Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
              effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to
              restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional
              hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal
              the badly injured.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              s an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy
              that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your
              cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and
              divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a
              creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't
              use this feature on an undead or a construct.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Blessed Healer</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal
              you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that
              restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit
              points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Divine Strike</h3>
            <p>
              At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes
              with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a
              creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an
              extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level,
              the extra damage increases to 2d8.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Supreme Healing</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more
              dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the
              highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of
              restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid
              spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at
              higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid
              table.

            <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
            <p>
              The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,
              you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
              all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to
              cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a
              number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid
              level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for
              which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level
              and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
              prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
              combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you
              can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
              doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
              long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time
              spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level
              for each spell on your list.

            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since
              your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You
              use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
              ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting
              the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
              attack roll with one.
            </p>

            <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
            <p>
              You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
            <p>
              You can use a
              <a href="/dnd/5e/srd/equipment#druidic-foci">druidic focus</a>
              (see “Equipment") as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

            <h2>Wild Shape</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume
              the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this
              feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or
              long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as
              shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you
              can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or
              lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

            </table>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half
              your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal
              form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert
              to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.
              You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit
              points, or die.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
                beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and
                Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all
                of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to
                gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same
                proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher
                than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the
                creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit
                Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the
                number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if
                you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
                damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you
                take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left,
                you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage
                doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't
                knocked unconscious.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any
                action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of
                your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration
                on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from
                taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning,
                that you've already cast.
              </li>
              <li>
                You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
                other source and can use them if the new form is physically
                capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special
                senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that
                sense.
              </li>
              <li>
                You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your
                space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn
                equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is
                practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based
                on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change
                size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the
                new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with
                it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you
                leave the form.

            <h2>Druid Circle</h2>
            <p>
              At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such
              as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd
              level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Timeless Body</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you
              to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages
              only 1 year.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Beast Spells</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in
              any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic
              and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but
              you aren't able to provide material components.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Archdruid</h2>
            <p>
              At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of
              times.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of
              your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a
              cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both
              your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Circle of the Land</h2>
            <p>
              The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who
              safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral
              tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or
              standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's
              wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that
              hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those
              folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the
              land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Bonus Cantrip</h3>
            <p>
              When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional
              druid cantrip of your choice.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Natural Recovery</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy
              by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short
              rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots
              can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your
              druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level
              or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a
              long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to
              two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a
              2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Circle Spells</h3>
            <p>
              Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability
              to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain
              access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a
              druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland,
              mountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it
              prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you
              can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't
              appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid
              spell for you.

              Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain
              costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical
              plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from
              them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

              In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants

              When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense
              your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When
              a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a
              Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed
              save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack
              automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune
              to this effect for 24 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack

              <h4>Sacred Plants and Wood</h4>
              <small>
                A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder,
                ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,
                willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a
                spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or
                sprigs of mistletoe.
              </small>
              <small class="smindent">
                Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such
                as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and
                rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be
                fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with
                strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons,
                such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is
                associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons,
                such as darts or javelins.
              </small>
              <small class="smindent">
                Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have
                chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a
                druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus
                plants.

              <h4>Druids and the Gods</h4>
              <small>
                Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most
                druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped
                in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH- B include
                many such deities). The worship of these deities is often
                considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics
                and urbanized peoples.

            <h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3>
            <p>
              When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
              modifier to the damage of the second attack.

            <h2>Second Wind</h2>
            <p>
              You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect
              yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to
              regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use
              this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can
              use it again.

            <h2>Action Surge</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal
              limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional
              action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest
              before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use
              it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

            <h2>Martial Archetype</h2>
            <p>
              At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate
              in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The
              archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at
              7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

              and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice
              by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
              As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Extra Attack</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
              whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level
              in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Indomitable</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you
              fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use
              this feature again until you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th

            <h2>Martial Archetypes</h2>
            <p>
              Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their
              fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate
              reflects your approach.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Champion</h2>
            <p>
              The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical
              power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on
              this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence
              to deal devastating blows.

            <h3>Improved Critical</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon
              attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Remarkable Athlete</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus
              (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you
              make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you
              can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength
              modifier.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Additional Fighting Style</h3>

              At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting
              Style class feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Superior Critical</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit
              on a roll of 18-20.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Survivor</h3>
            <p>
              At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At
              the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5
              + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your
              hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit
              points.

              Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not
              wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier +

            <h2>Martial Arts</h2>
            <p>
              At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
              combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are
              shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-
              handed or heavy property.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding
              only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a
              shield:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and
                damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed
                strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels,
                as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk
                weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus
                action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack
                with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a
                bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action
                this turn.

            </ul>
            <p class="pindent">
              Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For
              example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood
              connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a
              shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use
              for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for
              the weapon.

            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the
              mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by
              a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of
              points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk
              table.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start
              knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and
              Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in
              this class.

            <p class="pindent">
              When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a
              short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your
              expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes
              of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving
              throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is

            <h2>Unarmored Movement</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you
              are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases
              when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces
              and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Monastic Tradition</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic
              tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants
              you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Deflect Missiles</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or
              catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When
              you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10
              + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is
              small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one
              hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki
              point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of
              ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make
              this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon
              proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the
              attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60
              feet.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Slow Fall</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to
              reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five
              times your monk level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Extra Attack</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
              whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Stunning Strike</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an
              opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon
              attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The
              target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned
              until the end of your next turn.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ki-Empowered Strikes</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for
              the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
              attacks and damage.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Evasion</h2>
            <p>
              At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the
              way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning
              breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect
              that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
              damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving
              throw, and only half damage if you fail.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Stillness of Mind</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect
              on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Purity of Body</h2>
            <p>
              At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes
              you immune to disease and poison.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds
              so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any
              creature that can understand a language can understand what you
              say.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Diamond Soul</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency
              in all saving throws.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can
              spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Timeless Body</h2>
            <p>
              At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the
              frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still
              die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or
              water.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Empty Body</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki
              points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you
              also have resistance to all damage but force damage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent"></p>
            Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral
            projection spell, without needing material components. When you do
            so, you can't take any other creatures with you.
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Perfect Self</h2>
            <p>
              At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points
              remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Monastic Traditions</h2>
            <p>
              Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries
              scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one
              tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and
              instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest.
              All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging
              as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a
              tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Way of the Open Hand</h2>
            <p>
              Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of
              martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn
              techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal
              damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can
              protect them from harm.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Open Hand Technique</h3>
            <p>
              Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can
              manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you
              hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of
              Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
              </li>
              <li>
                It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push
                it up to 15 feet away from you.
              </li>
              <li>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Wholeness of Body</h3>
            <p>
              At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action,
              you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level.
              You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Tranquility</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that
              surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest,
              you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the
              start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal).
              The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier
              + your proficiency bonus.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Quivering Palm</h3>
            <p>
              At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in
              someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike,
              you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations,
              which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The
              vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To
              do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence.
              When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution
              saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it
              succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at
              a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without
              using an action.

            <h2>Divine Sense</h2>
            <p>
              The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a
              noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your
              ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such
              forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of
              any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not
              behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or
              undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its
              identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).
              Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place
              or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the
              hallow spell.
            </p>

              You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your

              Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing
              power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool,
              you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin
              level x 5.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the

            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of

              affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize
              multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit

              a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can

            <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>
              By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through
              meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
            <p>
              The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher,
              you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
              all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you
              to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so,
              choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier
              + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell).
              The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four
              1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14,
              your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
              wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot.
              Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
              spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent
              in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for
              each spell on your list.

            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells,
              since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.
              You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
              ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting
              the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making
              an attack roll with one.

            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon
              attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to
              the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage
              is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level
              higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8
              if the target is an undead or a fiend.

            <p>
              When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a
              paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory
              stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you
              choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th,

              Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to
              these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once
              you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared.
              Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can
              prepare each day.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">

              explains how to use it.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to

              ome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use

              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As

              10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a
              bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a
              minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
            </p>

              By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all
              your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever
              you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an
              extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with
              an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine
              Smite.

            <h2>Sacred Oaths</h2>
            <p>
              Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to
              the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness.
              The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the
              culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with
              this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have
              reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual
              swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has
              always been true in the paladin's heart.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>
            <p>
              The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of
              justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white
              knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the
              knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice
              and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest
              standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest
              of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are
              devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the
              measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants
              of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings
              into their helmets or coats of arms.

            <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
            <p>
              When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two
              Channel Divinity options.
            </p>
            <div class="inline-div">
              <h4>Sacred Weapon.</h4>
              <p>
                As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with
                positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you
                add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon
                (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light
                in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the
                weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the
                duration.
              </p>
              <p class="pindent">
                You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other
                action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or
                if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="inline-div">
              <h4>Turn the Unholy.</h4>
              <p>
                As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
                censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each
                fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
                must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its
                saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes
                damage.
              </p>
              <p class="pindent">
                A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far
                away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space
                within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its
                action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an
                effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move,
                the creature can use the Dodge action.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Aura of Devotion</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet
              of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Purity of Spirit</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a
              protection from evil and good spell.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Holy Nimbus</h3>
            <p>
              At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight.
              For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius,
              and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light,
              the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws
              against spells cast by fiends or undead.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
              a long rest.

            <h4>Breaking Your Oath</h4>
            <small
              >A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but
              even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right
              path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the
              lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a
              paladin to transgress his or her oath.</small
            >
            <small class="sminline">
              paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a
              cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the
              same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer
              as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of
              self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the
              paladin starts fresh.
            </small>
            <small class="smiline"
              >If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign
              of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's
              discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this
              class and adopt another.</small

              Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to
              choose again.

            <h3>Dueling</h3>
            <p>

              weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

            <h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3>
            <p>
              When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
              modifier to the damage of the second attack.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>
              By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the
              magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
            <p>
              The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and
              have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
              cast animal friendship using either slot.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
            <p>
              You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell
              list.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn
              more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of
              a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
              reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
              or 2nd level.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose
              one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another
              spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level
              for which you have spell slots.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since
              your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom
              whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
              you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for
              a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

            <h2>Ranger Archetype</h2>
            <p>
              At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate,
              such as the Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level
              and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Primeval Awareness</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one
              ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around
              you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can
              sense whether the following types of creatures are present within
              1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored
              terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey,
              fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures'
              location or number.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Extra Attack</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
              whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Land's Stride</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain
              costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical
              plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from
              them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants
              that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such
              those created by the entangle spell.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Hide in Plain Sight</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage
              for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants,
              soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create
              your camouflage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by
              pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or
              wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10
              bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there
              without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action
              or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this
              benefit.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Vanish</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus
              action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical
              means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Feral Senses</h2>
            <p>
              At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight
              creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see,
              your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your
              attack rolls against it.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature
              within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden
              from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Foe Slayer</h2>
            <p>
              At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.
              Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to
              the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against
              one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature
              before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are
              applied.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Hunter</h2>
            <p>
              Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a
              bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As
              you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for
              fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of
              orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

            <div class="inline-div">
              <h4>Colossus Slayer.</h4>
              <p>
                Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a
                creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8
                damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this
                extra damage only once per turn.
              </p>

            <div class="inline-div">
              <h4>Giant Killer.</h4>
              <p>
                When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or
                misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack
                that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you
                can see the creature.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="inline-div">
              <h4>Horde Breaker.</h4>
              <p>
                Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you
                can make another attack with the same weapon against a different
                creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within
                range of your weapon.

            <h3>Defensive Tactics</h3>
            <p>
              At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your
              choice.
            </p>
            <div class="inline-div">
              <h4>Escape the Horde.</h4>

                When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's
                fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make
                a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead
                take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half

                When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can
                use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same

            <h2>Expertise</h2>
            <p>
              At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of
              your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools.
              Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make
              that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in
              skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Sneak Attack</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit
              a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6
              damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have
              advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a
              ranged weapon.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of
              the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated,
              and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in
              this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue
              table.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Thieves' Cant</h2>
            <p>
              During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix
              of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in
              seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows
              thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times
              longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same
              idea plainly.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used
              to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is
              dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is
              nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will
              provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Cunning Action</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you
              to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of
              your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the
              Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Roguish Archetype</h2>
            <p>
              At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the
              exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype
              choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th,
              13th, and 17th level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and
              19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by
              2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Uncanny Dodge</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you
              with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's
              damage against you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Evasion</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of
              certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an
              ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows
              you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you
              instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and
              only half damage if you fail.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Reliable Talent</h2>
            <p>
              By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they
              approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets
              you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or
              lower as a 10.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Blindsense</h2>
            <p>
              Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of
              the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of
              you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Slippery Mind</h2>
            <p>
              By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain
              proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Elusive</h2>
            <p>
              Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely
              gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage
              against you while you aren't incapacitated.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Stroke of Luck</h2>
            <p>
              At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you
              need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn
              the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check,
              you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
              a short or long rest.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Roguish Archetypes</h2>
            <p>
              Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on
              perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to
              combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different
              rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the
              rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your
              focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but
              a description of your preferred techniques.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Thief</h2>
            <p>
              You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits,
              cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype,
              but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional
              treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In
              addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills
              useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar
              languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Fast Hands</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by
              your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check,
              use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take
              the Use an Object action.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Second-Story Work</h3>
            <p>
              When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability
              to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra
              movement.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover
              increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Supreme Sneak</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth)
              check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Use Magic Device</h2>
            <p>
              By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic
              that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not
              intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level
              requirements on the use of magic items.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Thief's Reflexes</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying
              ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns
              during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at
              your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative
              minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

            <p>
              An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor,
              left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic.
              This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

            <h3>Cantrips</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the
              sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of
              your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
              column of the Sorcerer table.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spell Slots</h3>
            <p>
              The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
              your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer
              spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
              regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and
              have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
              cast burning hands using either slot.

            <h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
            <p>
              You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer
              spell list.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn
              more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be
              of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
              reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
              or 2nd level.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose
              one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another
              spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level
              for which you have spell slots.

            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells,
              since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project
              your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell
              refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
              Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer
              spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

              Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your
              innate magical power, such as Draconic Bloodline.

            <h2>Font of Magic</h2>
            <p>
              At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within
              yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which
              allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

            <h3>Sorcery Points</h3>
            <p>
              You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher
              levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer
              table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the
              table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you
              finish a long rest.

              You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or
              sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn
              other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

              When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving
              throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s
              full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a
              number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of
              one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its
              saving throw against the spell.

            <h3>Distant Spell</h3>
            <p>
              When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you
              can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1

            <h3>Empowered Spell</h3>
            <p>
              When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
              reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier
              (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.
            </p>

              You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a

              When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer,
              you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum
              duration of 24 hours.

              When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving
              throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to
              give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving
              throw made against the spell.

              When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can
              spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus
              action for this casting.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Subtle Spell</h3>
            <p>
              When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it
              without any somatic or verbal components.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Twinned Spell</h3>
            <p>
              When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't
              have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points
              equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range
              with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              o be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than
              one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic
              missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost is.

            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.

            <h2>Sorcerous Restoration</h2>
            <p>
              At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you
              finish a short rest.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Sorcerous Origins</h2>
            <p>
              Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate
              magic, such as a draconic bloodline.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Draconic Bloodline</h2>
            <p>
              Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with
              your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with
              this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of
              ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even
              have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well
              established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer
              could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or
              some other exceptional circumstance.

            <h3>Dragon Ancestor</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The
              damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you
              gain later.

              You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever
              you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your
              proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Draconic Resilience</h3>
            <p>
              As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of
              your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point
              maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain
              a level in this class.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of
              dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals
              13 + your Dexterity modifier.

          <div>
            <h3>Elemental Affinity</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of
              the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your
              Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same
              time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that
              damage type for 1 hour.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Dragon Wings</h3>
            <p>
              At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon
              wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current
              speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn.
              They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor
              is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate
              your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

          <div>
            <h3>Draconic Presence</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of
              your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck
              or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to
              draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice)
              to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your
              concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each
              hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on
              a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or
              frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature
              that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24
              hours.

              At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being
              of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each
              of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your
              choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th,
              and 14th level.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Pact Magic</h2>
            <p>
              Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron
              have given you facility with spells.

            <p>
              You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list.
              You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher
              levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock
              table.

              The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table
              also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell
              slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of
              1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell
              slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one
              of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

              more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A
              spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in
              the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th
              level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be
              1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

            <p>
              Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so
              you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
              ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting
              the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making
              an attack roll with one.

            <p>
              In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch
              invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with
              an abiding magical ability.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice.
              Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class
              description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain
              additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations
              Known column of the Warlock table.
            </p>

            <h2>Pact Boon</h2>
            <p>
              At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for
              your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your
              choice.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Pact of the Chain</h3>
            <p>
              You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
              spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms
              for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp,
              pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one
              of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of
              its own with its reaction.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>Pact of the Blade</h3>
            <p>
              You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty
              hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each
              time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it.
              This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming
              resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from
              you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this
              feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or
              if you die.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by
              performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform
              the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a
              short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
              extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your
              pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient
              weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if
              you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon,
              or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon
              appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when
              the bond breaks.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Pact of the Tome</h3>
            <p>
              Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When
              you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's
              spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the
              book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They
              don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't
              appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock
              spells for you.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour
              ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony
              can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the
              previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.

            <h2>Mystic Arcanum</h2>
            <p>
              At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret
              called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock
              spell list as this arcanum.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell
              slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that
              can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one
              8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th
              level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish
              a long rest.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h2>Eldritch Master</h2>
            <p>
              At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical
              power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots.
              You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain
              all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once
              you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long
              rest before you can do so again.

            <p>
              If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to
              learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you
              meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level
              in this class.

            <p>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</p>
            <p>
              You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows.
              Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any
              class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The
              spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of
              spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast
              the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as
              rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can
              also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the
              ritual tag.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book
              of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book
              if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock
              level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the
              spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process
              takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe
              it.

              You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive
              through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the
              creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use
              your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection,
              extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While
              perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from
              any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded
              and deafened to your own surroundings.

            <h2>Otherworldly Patrons</h2>
            <p>
              The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty
              inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost
              godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access
              to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors
              in return.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge
              relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to
              their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and
              might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the
              same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>The Fiend</h2>
            <p>
              You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of
              existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against
              those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of
              all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to
              forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus,
              Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater,
              Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are
              especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the
              yugoloths.

            <h3>Dark One's Blessing</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
              points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma
              modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).

            <h3>Dark One's Own Luck</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate
              in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw,
              you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so
              after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects
              occur.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish

            <h3>Fiendish Resilience</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you
              finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage
              type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage
              from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Hurl Through Hell</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack,
              you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through
              the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a
              nightmare landscape.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it
              previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the
              target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels
              from its horrific experience.

              choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
              the Wizard table.

            <h3>Spellbook</h3>
            <p>
              At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard
              spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the
              wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in
              your mind.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
            <p>
              The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you
              to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your
              spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level
              (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which
              you have spell slots.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level
              and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your
              list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you
              prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a
              1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it
              from your list of prepared spells.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent
              studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and
              gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per
              spell level for each spell on your list.

            <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
            <p>
              Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
              since you learn your spells through dedicated study and
              memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to
              your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
              modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you
              cast and when making an attack roll with one.
            </p>

            <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
            <p>
              You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't
              need to have the spell prepared.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
            <p>
              You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your
              wizard spells.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
            <p>
              Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells
              of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells
              must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the
              Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that
              you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Arcane Recovery</h2>
            <p>
              You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying
              your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can
              choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
              combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard
              level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or
              higher.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to
              two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a
              2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Arcane Tradition</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping
              your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as
              Evocation.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th,
              10th, and 14th level.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
              level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
              you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
              normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
              feature.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Spell Mastery</h2>
            <p>
              At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells
              that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell
              and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can
              cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell
              slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell
              at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the
              spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Signature Spells</h2>
            <p>
              When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful
              spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level
              wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You
              always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the
              number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them
              once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so,
              you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must
              expend a spell slot as normal.

          <div>
            <h2>Arcane Traditions</h2>
            <p>
              The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest
              mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy
              gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex
              study.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around
              the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged
              thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called
              schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools.
              In other institutions, the schools are more like academic
              departments, with rival faculties competing for students and
              funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of
              their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a
              learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery
              of different techniques.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>School of Evocation</h2>
            <p>
              You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental
              effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder,
              crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find
              employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy
              armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect
              the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers,
              or aspiring tyrants.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Evocation Savant</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and
              time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook
              is halved.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Sculpt Spells</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety
              within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an
              evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you
              can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The
              chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws
              against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally
              take half damage on a successful save.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Potent Cantrip</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even
              creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature
              succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature
              takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional
              effect from the cantrip.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Empowered Evocation</h3>
            <p>
              Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to
              one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Overchannel</h3>
            <p>
              Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler
              spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that
              deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.
            </p>
            <p class="pindent">
              The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use
              this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12
              necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you
              cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a
              long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.
              This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

              intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the
              multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures.
              You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil
              wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient
              library.</small

            <h4>Copying a Spell into the Book.</h4>
            <small
              >When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add
              it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and
              if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</small
            >
            <small class="smindent">
              Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the
              basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of
              notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the
              spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then
              transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
            </small>
            <small class="smindent">
              For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs
              50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you
              experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks
              you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money,
              you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
            </small>
            <h4>Replacing the Book.</h4>
            <small
              >You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another
              book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your
              spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your
              spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own
              notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend
              only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</small
            >
            <small class="smindent">
              If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to
              transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
              Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find
              new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep
              backup spellbooks in a safe place.

            <h4>The Book's Appearance.</h4>
            <small>
              Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own
              decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain,
              functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your
              master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient
              library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together
              after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
