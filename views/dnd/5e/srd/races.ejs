                Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're
                considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average,
                they live about 350 years.

                Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a
                well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a
                strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to
                share in the benefits of a just order.

            <p>
              Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result

                Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as
                humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond
                physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf
                typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of
                100 and can live to be 750 years old.

                Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean
                strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and
                protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more
                often good than not.

              <p>
                Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
                remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for
                such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream
                after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that
                have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting
                in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8
                hours of sleep.

                You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is
                fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven
                literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are
                famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so
                they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

                believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other
                elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and

                and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for
                oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning
                heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of
                their old ways.

                The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to
                share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have
                a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is
                very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with
                the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are
                traveling.

                You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your

              When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the

              equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A
              creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much
              damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th

              <p>
                Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected
                to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can

              <p>
                Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages,
                engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors.
                Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters,
                wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and
                even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

                around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans,

                demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers.
                They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove
                unreliable, or at least unpredictable.
